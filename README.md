# ✈️ Airline On-Time Performance Analysis

This project explores the **Airline On-Time Performance** dataset to uncover patterns and factors contributing to flight **delays** and **cancellations** across the U.S. air travel network.

## 📊 Objective

To analyze airline performance data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (2003–2008) to answer key questions:

1. **Delay Patterns**

   * What time of day has the lowest average delays?
   * Which days of the week show better on-time performance?
   * Which months or seasons are most reliable?

2. **Delay Factors**

   * Identify and rank top 3–5 delay causes.
   * Quantify their impact in total delay minutes and percentage.

3. **Cancellation Analysis**

   * What are the primary reasons for cancellations?
   * Do cancellations correlate with specific airlines, airports, or time periods?

4. **Problematic Routes**

   * Which routes, carriers, or flight numbers show consistently poor performance?
   * What makes these flights prone to delays or cancellations?

## 🧰 Tools Used

* **SQL (Hive/Pig)** – for data extraction and transformation
* **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – for analysis and visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – for documentation and code execution
